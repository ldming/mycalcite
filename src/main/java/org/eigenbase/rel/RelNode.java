/**
 * A <code>RelNode</code> is a relational expression.
 *
 * <p>A relational expression is not a scalar expression; see
 * {@link org.eigenbase.sql.SqlNode} and {@link RexNode}.</p>
 *
 * <p>If this type of relational expression has some particular planner rules,
 * it should implement the <em>public static</em> method
 * {@link AbstractRelNode#register}.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a relational expression comes to be implemented, the system allocates
 * a {@link org.eigenbase.relopt.RelImplementor} to manage the process. Every
 * implementable relational expression has a {@link RelTraitSet} describing its
 * physical attributes. The RelTraitSet always contains a {@link Convention}
 * describing how the expression passes data to its consuming
 * relational expression, but may contain other traits, including some applied
 * externally. Because traits can be applied externally, implementations of
 * RelNode should never assume the size or contents of their trait set (beyond
 * those traits configured by the RelNode itself).</p>
 *
 * <p>For each calling-convention, there is a corresponding sub-interface of
 * RelNode. For example, {@code net.hydromatic.optiq.rules.java.EnumerableRel}
 * has operations to manage the conversion to a graph of
 * {@code net.hydromatic.optiq.rules.java.EnumerableConvention}
 * calling-convention, and it interacts with a
 * {@code EnumerableRelImplementor}.</p>
 *
 * <p>A relational expression is only required to implement its
 * calling-convention's interface when it is actually implemented, that is,
 * converted into a plan/program. This means that relational expressions which
 * cannot be implemented, such as converters, are not required to implement
 * their convention's interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every relational expression must derive from {@link AbstractRelNode}. (Why
 * have the <code>RelNode</code> interface, then? We need a root interface,
 * because an interface can only derive from an interface.)</p>
